1. Load the App Page
Start off by creating a directory structure for our SPA app. Open a terminal and go to a directory of your choosing.

$ mkdir -p simple-spa simple-spa/public && cd $_
$ mkdir -p js css
You should have a directory structure as follows.

your_directory
  |
  |-- simple-spa
        |
        |-- public
            |
            |-- css
            |-- js
Now create an HTML file app-1.html in the simple-spa/public directory and add the following contents.

public/app-1.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>A Simple SPA</title>

    <!-- 
        For fun we use base64 encoding for the favicon of the Space Invaders alien.
        This also stops the annoying HTTP GET 404 errors for the favicon file.
        See https://freeinvaders.org/ to kill some productive few minutes ;-)
    -->
    <link
        href="data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAEAEBAQAAEABAAoAQAAFgAAACgAAAAQAAAAIAAAAAEABAAAAAAAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOjv4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEAAAAAEBAAABAQAAAQEREREBAAABEREREREAAAARAREBEAAAAAEREREAAAAAABAAEAAAAAAAEAAQAAAAAAEAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD//wAA//8AAP//AAD//wAA//8AAPyfAADr6wAA6AsAAOADAADyJwAA+A8AAP3fAAD93wAA++8AAP//AAD//wAA"
        rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" />                    
</head>

<body>
    <h1>All pages will have this heading</h1>

    <div id="app">
        And the app will dynamically change this content.
    </div>

    <!--
        Load our JS code for this page.
    -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/app-1.js"></script> 
</body>

</html>
Let’s create app.js in the public/js folder.

public/js/app-1.js
window.addEventListener("load", () => {                                         
    console.log("Woohoo! We are running JS in the browser!");                   
});
We attach an anoymous function (or lambda) to the event load. This tells the browser to run the attached function when the page is loaded.
Just write to the console so we know that the script executed.
Finally, run a web server to serve up the pages. This is super easy. You have already done this with Python and Java. Let’s use Python …​ because we can ;-)

# make sure that you are in the simple-spa directory
$ python3 -m http.server ./public 5050
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 5050 (http://0.0.0.0:5050/) ...
Visit the page http://localhost:5050. Open your browser developer tools and look at the console. You should see the message that was printed to the console in app.js.

If you cannot get the above to work, do not continue. Everything after this point assumes you have a working web server and correctly executing JS in the browser.
